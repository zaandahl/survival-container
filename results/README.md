# research-framework results directory
Your methods should save their results here. This folder is *not* in version control!

Backup results from your methods in cloud-based storage (e.g. Dropbox, AWS S3).

Backup important methods to a separate location as well!

Keep results organised in folders indicating the date they were generated.

Update this README.md file with information about results and where to find them.

    2021-03-01/model_fits.rds - main model fits, stored in AWS
    2021-03-02/model_comparisons.rds - CV model comparisons stored in AWS
